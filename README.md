# Accountability mechanism

This is a mechanism which was developed during my bachelor thesis. It bases on regular expressions and allows to define log formats with a Java program. For more details, please refer to my thesis. 

## Getting started

 - Import this project in Eclipse or any other Java IDE. 
 - Ensure you have Java version >= 8
 - Start main/SimpleMain.java to start the Command line program or UiMain.java to start the user interface
